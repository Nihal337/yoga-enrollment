# Yoga Class Enrollment System

Welcome to the Yoga Class Enrollment System, where you can easily enroll users into various yoga class batches.

## Introduction

This project is a user-friendly platform allowing anyone to enroll themselves for yoga classes. The system collects information like the user's name, age, chosen batch time, enrollment date and also checks if the payment for the current month has been made or not. The age limit for enrollees is set between 18 and 65.

## Tech Stack
This project is built using [React](https://reactjs.org/). We used React hooks to manage the state of the application and [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) for making API requests to the backend server.

## Features

- User-friendly form to enroll in yoga classes.
- Validation checks for inappropriate values.
- Handles and displays error messages from the server.
- Shows payment status based on the API response.
- Stylish and responsive design.
